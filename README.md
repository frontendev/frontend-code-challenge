# Front-End Interview

## Run app

 ```bash
 $ yarn start
 ```

I've chosen React because i can inject CSS directly into the component and keep small sheets separately, which are more easy to read and let webpack build faster!

## The Task

The programming challenge exists in 2 parts:
* Part A: HTML + CSS (Completed)
* Part B: Javascript (Get stuck consuming the API)
